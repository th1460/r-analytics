# R + Analytics + IBM Cloud

In this training I will give an introduction to analytics, discuss its importance for the business area and discuss in detail about a framework to run a Data Science project (CRISP-DM). An R language will be presented as a tool for data analysis and its main libraries for: data visualisation, database manipulation, predictive models, creation of dashboards and web applications. The use of R will also be demonstrated with some IBM Cloud features such as: IBM Cloud Functions, Cloud Foundry and DB2.
